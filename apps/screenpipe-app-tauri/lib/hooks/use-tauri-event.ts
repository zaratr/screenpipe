/**
 * Subscribe to a Tauri backend event for the lifetime of the component.
 *
 * Wraps the `listen()` → async-setup → `unlisten()` dance that otherwise gets
 * copy-pasted at every call site (see the hand-rolled versions in
 * `components/update-banner.tsx` and `lib/hooks/use-settings.tsx`). Two
 * subtleties this hook handles once, correctly, so callers don't have to:
 *
 *  1. **Unmount-before-`await`-resolves race.** `listen()` returns a promise;
 *     if the component unmounts before it resolves, the naive pattern leaks a
 *     listener because the cleanup ran before `unlisten` existed. We track a
 *     `cancelled` flag and call `unlisten` the moment it resolves if we're
 *     already gone.
 *
 *  2. **Stable handler.** `handler` is kept in a ref, so passing an inline
 *     closure does NOT tear down and re-register the listener on every render.
 *     The subscription is re-created only when `event` or an explicit dep in
 *     `deps` changes.
 *
 * @param event   backend event name (e.g. "update-available")
 * @param handler invoked with the event payload; latest closure always used
 * @param deps    optional extra deps that should force a re-subscribe
